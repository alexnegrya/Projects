# Projects
## What is here?
Here is my projects that I write on **Python** language.
They are divided by topics. Try to run every module separately if in folder not present `app.py`, else run `app.py`.

## Recommendations
- Use [Refined GitHub Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf) or another to be able to download folders separately.

*Note: The projects are in different stages. Some of them may not be ready for use or may not work correctly.*
