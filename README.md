# Projects
## What is here?
Here is my projects that I write on **Python** language. They are devided by topic.

## Recommendations
- Use [Refined GitHub Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf) or another to be able to download folders separately.
- If you run module that can not work separately or is for view only, you will be notified.

*Note: The projects are in different stages. Some of them may not be ready for use or may not work correctly.*
